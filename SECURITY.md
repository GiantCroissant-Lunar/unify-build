Security fixes are applied to the main branch and the latest release. Older
versions are not actively maintained.

## Reporting Vulnerabilities

If you believe you have found a security vulnerability affecting unify-build
or its usage patterns:

- **Do not** open a public GitHub issue with exploit details.
- Instead, please report the issue privately using the contact method
  documented in the parent repository (for example, a security contact email
  or private issue channel).

When reporting, please include:

- A description of the issue and potential impact.
- Steps to reproduce, if possible.
- Any relevant environment details (.NET version, OS, etc.).

## Response Process

The maintainers will follow this timeline:

1. **Acknowledge** receipt of your report within **48 hours**.
2. **Investigate** and confirm the issue within 7 days.
3. **Fix critical vulnerabilities** within **30 days** of confirmation.
4. **Publish** a patched release with appropriate release notes.

For non-critical issues the fix timeline may be longer, depending on
complexity and impact.

## Disclosure Policy

- We follow coordinated disclosure. Please allow us reasonable time to
  address the issue before making any public disclosure.
- Once a fix is released, we will publish a security advisory crediting the
  reporter (unless anonymity is requested).
- If we are unable to reproduce or confirm the issue, we will communicate
  that back to the reporter with our findings.
