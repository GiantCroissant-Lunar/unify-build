We follow the spirit of the [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/)
Code of Conduct. In short:

- Be **respectful** and **inclusive**.
- Assume good faith and provide **constructive feedback**.
- Avoid personal attacks, harassment, and discriminatory behavior.

If you experience or witness unacceptable behavior in the context of this

behavior, editing or removing inappropriate content, or limiting participation
in the project where necessary.
